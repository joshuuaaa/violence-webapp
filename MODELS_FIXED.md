- Architecture: MobileNetV2 + Bidirectional LSTM
- Input: 16-frame sequences (224Ã—224 RGB each)
- Output: Violence probability (0-1)
- Parameters: 6.6M total (25.13 MB)
  - Trainable: 1.4M (5.50 MB)
  - Non-trainable: 2.3M (8.61 MB)
  - Optimizer: 2.9M (11.01 MB)

### Fire Model (best.pt)
**Status:** âœ… WORKING (already fixed)

Model details:
- File: models/best.pt (13.8 MB)
- Architecture: YOLOv5
- Classes: {0: 'no_fire', 1: 'fire'}
- Parameters: 7M (15.8 GFLOPs)

## Server Status

**Server running at:** http://127.0.0.1:8000

**Console output shows:**
```
âœ“ TensorFlow 2.20.0 loaded (CPU mode)
âœ“ Violence model loaded (MobileNetV2 + Bi-LSTM)
âœ“ YOLOv5 fire model loaded
âœ“ Server started successfully
```

## Installed Dependencies

All in one virtual environment (.venv):

**Core:**
- Python 3.13.3
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- NumPy 2.3.4, OpenCV 4.10.0

**Fire Detection:**
- PyTorch 2.9.0 (CPU)
- TorchVision 0.24.0
- Ultralytics 8.3.217
- pandas, seaborn, tqdm

**Violence Detection:**
- TensorFlow 2.20.0 âœ…
- Keras 3.11.3
- h5py, protobuf, grpcio

## How to Use

1. **Server is already running** at http://127.0.0.1:8000

2. **Open in browser:**
   - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000
   - Click "Start" button
   - Allow camera access

3. **What you'll see:**
   - Live webcam feed with detection overlays
   - Fire detection: Real-time bounding boxes (red = fire)
   - Violence score: Updates after first 16 frames
   - Alert status: Green = safe, Red = alert detected
   - Audio beep on alerts

4. **Features:**
   - Auto-recording when alerts trigger
   - Snapshots saved to `snapshots/`
   - Videos saved to `recordings/`
   - Dashboard shows history
   - Configurable thresholds via UI

## Testing

Run diagnostic anytime:
```bash
python test_models.py
```

Expected output:
- âœ“ Fire model found (13.8 MB)
- âœ“ Violence model found (25.7 MB)
- âœ“ PyTorch 2.9.0+cpu installed
- âœ“ TensorFlow 2.20.0 installed
- âœ“ Fire model loaded successfully
- âœ“ Violence model loaded successfully
- âœ“ FireModel initialized successfully
- âœ“ ViolenceModel initialized successfully

## Configuration

Edit thresholds via UI or `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
fps: 5                          # Frames per second
enable_violence: true           # Enable violence detection
enable_fire: true               # Enable fire detection
violence_sequence_length: 16    # Frames for violence analysis
violence_threshold: 0.6         # Alert threshold (0-1)
fire_threshold: 0.4             # Fire confidence threshold
recording_enabled: true         # Auto-record on alerts
pre_roll_seconds: 3             # Record before alert
post_roll_seconds: 5            # Record after alert
```

## Performance Notes

**Current setup (CPU-only):**
- Fire detection: ~5-10 FPS
- Violence detection: Processes 16-frame sequences
- Recommended FPS: 3-5 for smooth operation

**To improve performance:**
- Install CUDA PyTorch for GPU acceleration
- Reduce FPS in config
- Lower camera resolution in frontend
- Deploy on machine with GPU

## What's Next

**Recommended actions:**

1. **Test the app** - Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and try it!

2. **Tune thresholds** - Adjust sensitivity via Configuration panel

3. **Review alerts** - Check Dashboard for detection history

4. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Add email/SMS notifications
   - Integrate with security system
   - Deploy to cloud/edge device
   - Add more camera sources
   - Train custom models on your data

## Files Created/Modified

- `test_models.py` - Diagnostic script
- `MODEL_STATUS.md` - Technical documentation
- `MODELS_FIXED.md` - This file (success summary)
- `.venv/` - Now contains both TensorFlow and PyTorch

## Commit This Work

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix violence model loading - both models now working

- Install TensorFlow 2.20.0 (Python 3.13 compatible)
- Both fire and violence detection fully operational
- Update documentation with success status
